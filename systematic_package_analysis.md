## üîç **Kiro Architecture: AI-First Development Environment**

### **Platform Foundation**
Kiro is built on Code OSS (the open-source foundation of VS Code) but represents a fundamental reimagining of the development environment optimized for AI-first workflows.

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- **AI-First Design**: The entire interface and workflow optimized for AI collaboration
- **Spec-Driven Development**: Built-in methodology for systematic development processes
- **Cloud-Agnostic**: Works with any cloud provider despite being an Amazon product
- **Enterprise Ready**: Governance, compliance, and audit features built from the ground up

### **Specification-Driven Development Framework**
```
Project Structure:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md    # Business intent using EARS syntax
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md         # Technical architecture and components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md          # Implementation breakdown and execution plan
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .kiro/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ steering/     # AI behavior customization
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/        # Automation workflows
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/       # Project-specific settings
```

**The Innovation**: Living specifications that evolve with code, creating institutional memory for software projects. This addresses the critical problem of lost context and intent as projects evolve.

### **AI Integration Architecture**
**Model Access**: Free Claude Sonnet 4.0 and 3.7 during preview (typically $20+ elsewhere)
**Agent Modes**:
- **Autopilot Mode**: Maximum autonomy with minimal human oversight
- **Supervised Mode**: Collaborative development with approval workflows
- **Spec Mode**: Structured development following specification methodology

**Agent Steering System**:
```
.kiro/steering/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product.md      # Product vision and features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ structure.md    # Project organization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tech.md         # Technology stack decisions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libraries.md    # Custom development standards
```

### **MCP Protocol Implementation**
**Full Runtime Protocol**: Unlike GitHub Copilot's configuration assistance, Kiro executes MCP tools directly
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-docs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Capabilities**:
- Server lifecycle management with auto-reconnection
- Tool discovery and execution from external MCP servers
- Context injection from MCP tools into AI conversations
- Security controls with auto-approval for trusted tools

### **Agent Hooks System**
Event-driven automation enabling custom workflows:
- **Git Automation**: Automatic commits when tasks complete
- **Documentation Sync**: Updates project docs when code changes
- **Code Quality**: Monitors for improvements and best practices
- **Custom Workflows**: Natural language hook creation
